								<h1>Legal & Policy</h1>
                                <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At G13, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
								<p>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</p>

								<p>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</p>
                                <p>We don't store personal information on our servers or the offsite servers of the third party service providers we use to provide our core services unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</p>
								
                                <p>In our social networking and mobile application products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</h2>
                                
                                <p>G13 operates several websites including G13 (collectively, the "Websites"), as well as a number of mobile applications on behalf of our customers (collectively, the "Applications"). It is G13, policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Websites and Applications.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Website Visitors and Application Users</h2>
								
                                <p>G13, collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.G13, ' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how G13, ' visitors use its Websites and Applications. From time to time, G13 may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Websites or Applications.</p>
								
                                <p>G13 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Such information can include location data and information of end users. G13 does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
								
                                <p>Certain visitors to G13, Websites and users of G13, Applications choose to interact with G13, in ways that require G13, to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that G13, gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a social network at G13 to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with G13, – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, G13 collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor interaction with G13. G13 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website-related and Application-related activities.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                                
                                <p>G13 may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Websites and users of its Applications. For instance, G13 may monitor the most popular social networks on the G13 site. G13 may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, G13 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                                
                                <p>G13 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on G13 behalf or to provide services available at  and Applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. For instance, G13 uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, data storage, and related technology required to run the services available at G13, Websites, and Applications. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using G13 Websites and Applications, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. G13 will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, G13 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when G13 believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of G13, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an G13 Websites or Applications and have supplied your email address, G13 may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what going on with G13 and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. G13 takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                                
                                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor computer, and that the visitor browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. G13 uses cookies to help G13 identify and track visitors, their usage of the G13 Websites, and their website access preferences. G13 visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using G13 Websites, with the drawback that certain features of G13 Websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Ads</h2>
                                
                                <p>Ads appearing on any of our Websites or Applications may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by G13 and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
								
                                <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
                                
                                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, G13 may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in G13 ' sole discretion.
